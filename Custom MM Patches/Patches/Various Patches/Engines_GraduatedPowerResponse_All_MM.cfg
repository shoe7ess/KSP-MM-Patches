// NOTE: I can NOT remember if I pulled this from KWRocketry and just trimmed it or found it online so therefore cannot take any credit for
//  this patch. KWRocketrry (iirc) includes a number of patches like this as optional configs for one and I may have gotten this from a patch
//  that was already posted on the KSP forums.

// This MM patch does what it says on the tin; makes engine acceleration and deceleration take some time. This is a blanket patch, it does not differentiate
//  spooling times based on engine type or size (besides solid fuel engines, which this skips entirely) so if you want an engine to
//  accel/decel faster or slower just copy and paste with whatever part names you need
