// I made this config when I created and spent a good amount of time in a career game before realizing that I couldn't do certain things
//  within the USI mod because kerbals on my station didn't have this trait, thus I gave them this trait via MM patch
//  This ISNT necessary if you simply turn the option off when creating your career game (that kerbals need this skill to repair/destroy)
//  however I'm sure it has its uses so I threw it up on here anyway.
